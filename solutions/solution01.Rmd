This session is about reading in, displaying and summarising point patterns.  
The lecturer's R script is [available here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spatstat/SSAI2017/master/Scripts/script01.R) (right click and save).

If you have not already done so, you’ll need to start R and load the `spatstat`
package by typing
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(spatstat)
```

### Exercise 1
We will study a dataset that records the locations of Ponderosa Pine
trees (*Pinus ponderosa*) in a study region in the
Klamath National Forest in northern California. The data are
included with `spatstat` as the dataset `ponderosa`.

1.  assign the data to a shorter name, like `X` or `P`;

    To assign the data to `X` we simply write:
    
    ```{r}
    X <- ponderosa
    ```

2.  plot the data;

    To plot the data we do the following:
    
    ```{r}
    plot(X)
    ```

    By the S3 method dispatch, this calls the `plot.ppp` function.
    The `chars` argument indicate that the point type should be be periods ("`.`").

3.  find out how many trees are recorded;

    Both `npoints` and `print.ppp` displays the number of recorded trees:

    ```{r}
    npoints(X)
    print(X)
    ```
    
    I.e. there are 108 trees in the dataset.

4.  find the dimensions of the study region;

    The dimensions of the observation window can be seen above. Alternatively, it
    can be directly assesed via

    ```{r}
    window(X)
    ```

5.  obtain an estimate of the average intensity of trees (number of
    trees per unit area).

    The average intensity can be computed via `intensity.ppp`
    
    ```{r}
    intensity(X)
    ```

    or the more expansive `summary.ppp`:
    
    ```{r}
    summary(X)
    ```

### Exercise 2

The Ponderosa data, continued:

1.  When you type `plot(ponderosa)`, the command that is
    actually executed is `plot.ppp`, the plot method for
    point patterns. Read the help file for the function
    `plot.ppp`, and find out which argument to the
    function can be used to control the main title for the plot;

    From the documentation, the argument that controls the title is `main` as is 
    also the case in the regular generic `plot`.

2.  plot the Ponderosa data with the title *Ponderosa Pine
    Trees* above it;
  
    ```{r}
    plot(ponderosa, main = "Ponderosa Pine Trees")
    ```

3.  from your reading of the help file, predict what will happen if
    we type
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    plot(ponderosa, chars="X", cols="green")
    ```
    then check that your guess was correct;
    
    Each point will be plotted as an green "X" and indeed:
    
    ```{r}
    plot(ponderosa, chars="X", cols="green")
    ```

4.  try different values of the argument `chars`, for
    example, one of the integers 0 to 25, or a letter of the
    alphabet. (Note the difference between `chars=3` and
    `chars="+"`, and the difference between `chars=4` and
    `chars="X"`).

    There are subtle differences in the actual character/point types plotted.
    When given a string literal, the actual character is plotted as the point type.

    ```{r}
    plot(ponderosa, chars=3, cols="green")
    plot(ponderosa, chars="+", cols="green")
    plot(ponderosa, chars=4, cols="green")
    plot(ponderosa, chars="X", cols="green")
    ```


### Exercise 3

The following vectors record the locations of 10 scintillation events
observed under a microscope. Coordinates are given in microns, and
the study region was $30 \times 30$ microns, with the origin at the
bottom left corner.
```{r}
x <- c(13, 15, 27, 17, 8, 8, 1, 14, 19, 23)
y <- c(3, 15, 7, 11, 10, 17, 29, 22, 19, 29)
```
Create a point pattern `X` from the data,
and plot the point pattern (use `owin` or `square` to define the study region).

To define the observation window we do:

```{r}
w <- owin(c(0, 30), c(0, 30), unitname = c("micron", "microns"))
```

With this window, we create the `ppp` object with the funciton of the same name and plot it:

```{r}
P <- ppp(x = x, y = y, window = w)
plot(P, main = "Scintillation events")
```

### Exercise 4

The file `anthills.txt` is available in the Data directory on 
[GitHub](https://github.com/spatstat/SSAI2017) and downloadable by 
[this direct link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spatstat/SSAI2017/master/Data/anthills.txt) (right click and save).

It records the locations of anthills recorded in a
1200x1500 metre study region in northern Australia.
Coordinates are given in metres, along with a letter code recording
the ecological ‘status’ of each anthill (in this exercise we will ignore this letter code).

1.  read the data into `R` as a data frame, using the `R` function
    `read.table`. (Since the input file has a header line, you
    will need to use the argument `header=TRUE` when you call
    `read.table`.)

    We read the data into R with the line:
    
    ```{r}
    dat <- read.table(file = "../Data/anthills.txt", header = TRUE)
    ```

2.  check the data for any peculiarities.

    Looking at the first entries of the dataset with
    
    ```{r}
    head(dat)
    ```

    We see that there is a `status` variable indicating that this is a *marked*
    point process.

3.  create a point pattern `hills` containing these data.
    Ensure that the unit of length is given its correct name.

    As before
    ```{r}
    hills <- with(dat, ppp(x, y, xrange = c(0, 1200), yrange = c(0, 1500), 
                           units=c("metre", "metres")))
    ```
    
    The `ppp` function passes the appropriate arguments to `owin` which we
    therefore do not need to call explicitly.

4.  plot the data.

    As before, we can now plot the data:
    
    ```{r}
    plot(hills, pch = 16, cex = 0.3, main = "Anthill locations")
    ````
